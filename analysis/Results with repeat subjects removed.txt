## Results when remove subjects who completed earlier experiment within experiment class

- That is, in the real object experiments, remove subjects who rated objects for complexity in RT, mapping, and production tasks
- And, in the geon experiments, remove subjects who rated geons for complexity in RT and mapping tasks

REAL OBJECTS
(1) RT task
N_removed: 16 (of 500)

(2) Mapping task
N_removed: 27 (of 1500)
correlation between RT and effect size: .7 (p<.01)
correlation between complexity and effect size: .68 (p<.01)

(3) Production task
(a) labels: N_removed: 2 (of 60), t=-4.17
(b) descriptions: N_removed: 7 (of 60), t=-2.7


GEONS
(1) RT task
N_removed: 15 (of 250)

(2) Mapping task
N_removed: 21 (of 750)
correlation between RT and effect size: .79 (p<.01)
correlation between complexity and effect size: .84 p<.01)
