README - norms
---

This folder contains all the by-item norms collected in the paper. 

[1] complexityNormsEnglishexp9.csv - Mean complexity rating for all 499 English words with bootstrapped 95% CIs, collected in Experiment 9. 

[2] complicatedNormsGeons_BYITEM_exp1.csv - Mean complicated rating for 40 geon objects with bootstrapped 95% CIs, collected in Experiment 1. The geons are identifed by "X-Y," where X corresponds to the number of geons, and Y corresponds to the item number. See Stimuli folder for images.

[3] complicatedNormsObjs_BYITEM_exp4.csv - Mean complicated rating for 60 naturalistic objects with bootstrapped 95% CIs, collected in Experiment 4. The objects are identified in the column "ratingNum." See Stimuli folder for images. The mean ratings are also included for the two independent samples("rating_1" and "rating_2"). "meanRating" is the average of these two samples. 

[4] rtNormsGeons_BYITEM_exp8a.csv - Mean reaction time for 40 geon objects with bootstrapped 95% CIs, collected in Experiment 8a. Note that reaction times are given in log space. The geons are identifed by "X-Y," where X corresponds to the number of geons, and Y corresponds to the item number. See Stimuli folder for images.

[5] rtNormsObjs_BYITEM_exp8b.csv - Mean reaction time for 60 naturalistic objects with bootstrapped 95% CIs, collected in Experiment 8b. Note that reaction times are given in log space. The objects are identified in the column "Answer.trainImage." See Stimuli folder for images.
