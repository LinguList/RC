README - stimuli

This folder contains all files of the object stimuli used in Experiments 1-8. Explicit complexity norms and reaction time norms for both stimulus sets can be found in analysis/data/norms/.  

Geons - This folder contains all 40 stimuli used in Experiments 1-3 and 8a.  The objects are composed of 1-5 geons, and for each level of complexity there are 8 different items. They are named "objX-Y.png," where X indicates the complexity level and Y indicates the item number.

Novel Real Objects - This folder contains the 60 novel real objects used in Experiment 4-6 and 8b. The objects are numbered arbitrarily. The ball and circuit items were used as anchor items, and are not part of the set of 60.
